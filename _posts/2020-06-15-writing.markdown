#### Writing on dev.to
Most of the technical articles I will be writing can be found on my [DEV page](https://dev.to/botanical). The reason I am moving over to writing technical pieces on DEV is the ease of sharing information in conjunction with the thriving DEV community I have come to love.

I will still be using my website to post snippets of writing for non-technical related opinion pieces or learnings.
